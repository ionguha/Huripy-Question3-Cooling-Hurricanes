# Do Hurricane cool land ?
### Question 3 of Project Hurripy

**_I was a part of a group of data scientists who took upon themselves to analyze the correlations between cyclones and impacting factors. Our analysis was presented as a project to the Data Analysis & Visualization Boot Camp â€“ McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin. The complete project is available at: https://github.com/TheGreekGoddess/Project_HurriPy
While my teammates worked on different impacting factors and demographic changes after a hurricane makes a landfall, I was intrigued by the possibility that hurricanes can produce a cooling effect on land_**
